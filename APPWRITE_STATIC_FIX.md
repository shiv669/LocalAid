# 🚀 Appwrite Static Hosting Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Output Directory Configuration

The "Page not found" error happens because Appwrite doesn't know where your built files are.

### Step-by-Step Fix:

## 1️⃣ In Appwrite Console

1. Go to your project: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-68fcedbf001c29286f39
2. Click **"Static Sites"** in the left sidebar
3. Find your deployment
4. Click **"Settings"** or the gear icon ⚙️

### 2️⃣ Configure These Settings EXACTLY:

```
Root Directory:        .
Output Directory:      out
Install Command:       npm install
Build Command:         npm run build
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The `Output Directory` MUST be set to `out` (not empty, not `.`, not `./out`, just `out`)

### 3️⃣ Redeploy

1. After saving settings, click **"Redeploy"** or make a new commit to trigger rebuild
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Your site should now work at your assigned URL

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After deployment, check:
- ✅ Build logs show: "Build command execution finished"
- ✅ Files are in `/out` folder locally
- ✅ `index.html` exists in `out/` directory
- ✅ Output Directory in Appwrite is set to `out`
- ✅ Homepage loads without 404

## 📁 Expected File Structure

Your `out/` folder should contain:
```
out/
├── index.html          ← Homepage
├── verify.html         ← Verify page  
├── 404.html           ← Error page
├── _next/             ← Next.js assets
│   └── static/
└── _redirects         ← Routing rules
```

## 🐛 Still Getting 404?

If you still see "router_path_not_found":

### Option A: Double-check Output Directory
1. Go to Static Sites → Settings
2. Verify **Output Directory** = `out` (no leading or trailing slashes)
3. Save and redeploy

### Option B: Manual Upload Test
1. Download the `out/` folder from your local build
2. In Appwrite Console → Static Sites
3. Try a manual upload of the `out` folder contents
4. If this works, the issue is the build config

### Option C: Check Build Logs
Look for these in deployment logs:
```
✓ Generating static pages (5/5)
Build command execution finished.
```

If you see errors about missing files, the build failed.

## 🎯 What Changed in This Fix

1. **`appwrite.json`** - Added proper project settings
2. **`public/_headers`** - Security and caching headers
3. **`next.config.ts`** - Already correct with `output: 'export'`
4. **Build output** - Goes to `out/` directory

## 📞 Need Help?

If still not working:
1. Share screenshot of Appwrite Static Site **Settings** page
2. Share last 20 lines of deployment logs
3. Confirm `out/index.html` exists locally after `npm run build`

## Alternative: Deploy to Vercel Instead

If Appwrite continues having issues, Vercel is recommended for Next.js:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

Follow prompts, and your site will be live in 2 minutes. 🚀
